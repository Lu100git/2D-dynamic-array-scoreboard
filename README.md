This is a simple score calculation board that decides if there is a winer or a tie between 
the desired input teams, the goal of this project was to demonstrate the usage of 2D dinamic arrays
Iand to translate c# code into c++ taken from a c# project video I found online,

I even bother adding a validation of numbers only in order to no break the program when a user tries to input
characters into the program
